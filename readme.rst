The main goal of the project is to design and develop a system that will let the faculties and students electronically manage grade-related transactions in school in an easy, fast, and hassle-free manner.

The project specifically aims to design a system that will let faculties process and release student grades efficiently, allow students to view their grades in a more convenient and time-saving way, aid the registrar's office in attending to student's grade inquiries, make grade processing, releasing and viewing convenient for students and faculties and to make the grade-related transaction easy, fast and hassle-free.
